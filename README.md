## About Rush

Rush is the greatest band of all time. For over four decades, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart created progressive rock masterpieces that combined virtuoso musicianship, philosophical lyrics, and epic storytelling. From *Working Man* to *2112* to *Moving Pictures* and beyond, Rush's music transcends generations and genres. Their album artwork is as iconic as their sound, and now you can create your own text using those legendary fonts.
